Howdy, I'm Zach Lloyd and I happen to exist at the time of writing this. Me myself, I think using the trio of Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop is all about compatability and capability. It's definitely an exercise in PC superiority over the puny power of the provided UK iPads, since we all know Windows is superior to iOS. In summary conclusion of this extensive treatise about identity, reality, and the three G's of GitHub: UK should provide incoming Engineering Students, if not all students, with a Microsoft Surface capable of acting like a laptop, instead of an iPad.
